# Welcome to the hash DB for every course served!

In order to make sure you are not getting scammed (*e.g, by somebody who claims to be selling our courses, but does not fully look like us*), we have decided to make this document the official record of all SHA1 (*only*) hashes for the files sold by SkyPenguinLabs.

This document is separated into two sections, both involving a table of the resource name, followed by its file type, hash, and description:

* **Sample or Free Downloadable Content** - This is all of the content which is found on our GitHub page, or on a remote server under the domain [skypenguinlabs](https://skypenguinlabs.wtf)

* **Paid Downloadable Content** - This is all of the content or media we release which is paid for. 


## Sample or Free Downloadable Content 
The table below lists the SHA1 hashes of every single FREE, immediately downloadable file. These include application demos, CTFs, and
