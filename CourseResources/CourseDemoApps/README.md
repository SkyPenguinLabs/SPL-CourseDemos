## SkyPenguinLabs Course Applications, Demos, Simulations, and CTFs

All folders in this document resemble a course that has been published on the internet (paid, or free) and the application (if one) the course uses for a demo, CTF, walkthrough, or more by SkyPenguinLabs.

The table below outlines the folders and their contents.

> [!TIP]
> Note that all of the contents you will find in the folders are documented with as much information as necessary to get them running or functioning. 


| Folder / Course Name | Explanation of contents |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | 
| [REC6](./REC6%20-%20How%20to%20analyze%20GUIs%20built%20for%20Windows)| All of the contents here revolve around the executable and the DLL the executable requires for reverse engineering. Thats all 
| [REC7](./REC7%20-%20Reverse%20Engineering%20BlackBoxed%20Golang%20Plugins)| All of the contents within this folder (all of one app, lol) are used within the REC7 course. 
| [PRGC3](./PRGC3%20-%20The%20Art%20of%20Frontend%20Validation) | All of the applications that are DEMO apps, not CTFs, not full production apps, or puzzles, just demo frontend ElectronJS apps that walk you through different validation mechanisms inside of frontend applications for uX 




> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember, if you are questioning your security in relation to the documents, every single document, or downloadable media produced by SkyPenguinLabs is ran through `sha1sum` and recorded [here](../CourseResources/HelpUsFightPiracy) for you to match and test out. Uploading to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e23a4697fce0e5db29a5e9409da0ac4cf27ad065fd6146d01f8af098b78a6290?nocache=1) is also recommended. If any media is obtained from a third-party service, its use is strongly discouraged. SkyPenguinLabs guarantees that all media is distributed exclusively through its official primary stores and domains owned and operated by SkyPenguinLabs, and is not resold through any other channels. If this is the case, it is most likely a phishing attempt or an action by a malicious third party falsely claiming to possess our content, with the intent of inducing you to download potentially harmful material. In which case, report it, and our legal team will handle this ASAP!
