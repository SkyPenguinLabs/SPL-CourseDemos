### Account Analysis & Breakdown Chart (Course: AIC0) 
---

All documents within this folder belong to the AIC0 course, which was developed and written by Totally_Not_A_Haxxer under SkyPenguinLabs. 

This canvas can be rendered in obsidian. 

> [!TIP]
> If you are worried about the contents of the images, and loading them inside of an application runtime, especially in apps like Obsidian, beware that all files have been hashed and documented inside of the `Channel1_Analysis1` folder in a file called `Hash Table for Assets` (not to be confused by the literal term - [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table))
