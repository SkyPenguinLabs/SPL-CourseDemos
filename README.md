### New to SkyPenguinLabs?
---

We are an upcoming experimental and continuously growing cybersecurity educational platform that sells courses, books, quick e-lessons, and other products basically monthly all on our shop for you to purchase [here](skypenguinlabs.etsy.com). 

Tired of expensive courses?
Tired of outdated BS?
Tired of AI generated annoyance?
Tired of content creators claiming to save your carrer?

No BS here, our courses are fairly evaluated through a pretty damn killer spreadsheet and created with large amounts of care, as everything from every piece of art, scheduling, and platform development belongs to SkyPenguinLabs. 

This repository is a perfect example of how open we are. Just check out the sections in this repository below.

| Section name | Section Description | What was the purpose of adding this? | 
| ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | 
| [Lesson Samples](./CourseSamples) | This entire directory holds a PDF that samples every single course SkyPenguinLabs has ever released. | We felt modern course providers did not provide meerly enough information to their buyers about the courses. Here, you get the freedom to peek inside a solid 10% of the content before you buy it.  Which is better than- wait, almost every content creator trying to push you courses T_T 
| [eBook Demos](./EbookSamples) | Similar to the course samples, but instead, samples a quarter of every single ebook we release. For example, have you heard of the Black Hat Go Manual, Black Hat Python Manual, Game Hackers Field Manual, OR Reverse Engineers Field Manual? All of those books are produced by SkyPenguinLabs and have their demo documents placed in this directory for everyone to view. | We felt that sellers like KDP, were not giving consumers enough peaks at the content in hand. For example, if we had a 400 page book on KDP, the buyer would only get to see 10 pages max. We give you at least 30 a books :D | 
| [Free Lessons](./Free_Lessons) | Every single season we release a set of free courses. Or any course we start making and dislike halfway through, we make it free to the public. All stored in this directory | What can we say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ our researchers get bored when we release on a schedule and outpace it 
| [QR Db!!!!](./QRs) | For saftey purposes, if you see a QR posted somewhere, and it has our branding on it, make sure its the right qr by going to this directory and checking if it's on the list of QRs. If the name on the QR is not at all associated with what you are looking at, and none exists, its not ours! | For in-person giveaways, conference visits and more
| [Hash Db!!!](./CourseResources/HelpUsFightPiracy) | This is a database we created to make sure that if ANYBODY tries to get you or anybody else to download a free sample of a paid course, a paid course for free, or tries to say they are selling our course for half off and use our graphics, you can make sure the PDF file you download  is not malicious, and the assets or files along side of it by using this repository to reference the SHA1 hash. | Too many people try to mimic publicly available CTFs and ruin the answers, stuff them with malicious code, or target learners by using our branding to catch people; its happened before. So, we built this for the community! Every app, digital media file (pdf, doc, data sample, etc.) is hashed and documented here 
| [DemoApps](./DemoApps) | For every single course that is released, which depends upon an app, plugin, file, set of metadata, or CTF we build, all of the source code and or binaries, along with specific instructions for those files, get uploaded to this repository. This gives you everything you need for each paid course. | We needed to find a way to collect all of the apps that our courses were going to depend on. This felt like the way. Some are hosted on our domain, and documented here, but source code is held here along with minimal binaries (below 20kb)
